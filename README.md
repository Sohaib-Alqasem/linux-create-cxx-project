### Use Cases
* Navigate to what dir you want
* run the script 
Ex:
```
npx linux-create-cxx-project <appName>
```
### To build and compile your code
  ```

  npm run exe
  ```
  
### To build a release
   ```
   npm release
   npm run exe
   ```

### To import static library
   * Move header files to include dir
   * Move xxx.a file to libs dir

### To import dynamic library
   * Move header files to include dir
   * Move xxx.so file to libs dir
     
### To create a library
  ```

  ```
       * lib types
          - st >> static
          - dy >> shared
